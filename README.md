## ABOUT ME

It is my hope to one day work in the area of computer science and artificial intelligence. I am intrigued and fascinated by the seemingly unlimited potential of these areas of study and development to improve the quality of life. It is my desire to learn as much as possible about all areas of computer science and the development of artificial intelligence.
